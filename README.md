Cattle Treatments App
=====================

This app records tag numbers and treatments for sick cattle into your Trello board.
If you don't have a Trello account, just sign up for one for free when you first
go to my app and it redirects you to Trello to sign in.  Once signed in,
it will make a Livestock board with lists for Treatments, In, Dead, and Config.  

The treatments and tag colors are set in the descriptions of cards on the Config list.

The app currently doesn't use the In list, and you have to enter tag numbers manually
into the Dead list to get the dead stats.  Work in progress.
